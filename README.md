# OpenBoxes
OpenBoxes will start unlocking boxes, watch ads to cut the time, and open boxes for you. 

DISCLAIMER:
Again, use this at your own risk because if you give it the wrong inputs, it might spend gems on accident! Also, make sure you keep an eye on it because the game only allows you to watch a certain amount of ads. When the script arrives to the end, it may accidentally spend your gems!

Instructions for Mac:
1. Download OpenBoxes.sh to your computer by right-clicking the file and clicking Save Link As... or something like that.
2. Plug Android device with USB debugging enabled to computer with ADB installed.
3. Open Terminal and navigate to the OpenBoxes.sh file. (Instructions for navigating in Terminal: http://yoalizer.com/1Us6)
4. Have CATS opened on Android device on the main menu. Unless it's the top-left box, no boxes should be unlocking.
5. Type "sh OpenBoxes.sh # # # #" replacing the # with the number of ads to watch to unlock the boxes in the order from top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom right. (e.g. say you have 2H box, 6H box, 6H box, and 2H box. you would type "sh OpenBoxes.sh 4 12 12 4") Remember, the numbers are the amount of ads the script must watch to open the box. So if the top-left box is already unlocking and it has 1H 4M left, you would type 3 for it because it takes 3 watches of ads to open the box.
